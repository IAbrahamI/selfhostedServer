## Network Configuration

Most services are configured to use an external Docker network for inter-container communication. This ensures secure and isolated communication between services while allowing them to work together when needed.

## Getting Started

1. Each service directory contains its own `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Configure the environment variables and paths as needed
3. Use `docker-compose up -d` in each directory to start the services
4. Access the services through their respective web interfaces

## Security Notes

- Make sure to change default passwords
- Keep services updated regularly
- Use strong passwords for all admin interfaces
- Consider enabling 2FA where available
- Review and customize access permissions

## Backups

Remember to regularly backup:
- Configuration files
- Data volumes
- Database contents
- SSL certificates
